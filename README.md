Dapp

Overview- Dapp is a decentralized application built using React. It leverages Firebase for backend services, Ethers for blockchain interactions, and TailwindCSS for styling. The project includes essential tools and configurations for development and testing to ensure a smooth development experience.

Features-
•React: For building the user interface.
•TailwindCSS: For responsive and utility-first CSS styling.
•Firebase: For backend services.
•Ethers: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
•Hardhat: For testing and deploying the smart contract.


Frontend-The frontend of dapp is built using React and TailwindCSS:

React is used for creating the interactive user interface, providing a smooth and dynamic user experience.
TailwindCSS is used for styling, offering a utility-first approach that enables rapid and responsive design implementation.
Ethers.js is used for connecting the frontend with the smart contract, enabling blockchain interactions such as product registration and purchase.

Smart Contract: SupplyChain-
The SupplyChain smart contract manages the lifecycle of products on the Ethereum blockchain using ERC721 tokens. Key functionalities include:

Registering Products: Users can register new products, which are represented as unique ERC721 tokens.
Purchasing Products: Users can purchase products by transferring Ether, with ownership and status updates managed by the contract.
Deleting Products: The contract manager can delete purchased products, ensuring efficient contract state management.
The contract ensures transparency and traceability of product ownership and status through blockchain technology.

Development-Hardhat is used for testing, deploying, and debugging the smart contract. It provides a robust development environment for Ethereum-based projects.
